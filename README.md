# Build Locally

See https://github.com/gardenlinux/package-build/blob/main/docs/local_build.md


# Publishing local version to Garden Linux image

1. Create a branch https://gitlab.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux-package-runc 
2. Upload artifacts to git-lfs (or setup S3+OIDC, but this requires more steps.. just use git lfs if possible)
3. create a custom .gitlab/ci/build.yml that downloads the artifact (from git-lfs or S3)
4. mark the downloaded artifact as build artifact with gitlab syntax (check other build.yml for example)
5. set git tag to version accordingly e.g. 1.1.11-1gardenlinux1 (depending on the version of the artifact
6. create a garden linux minor release as usual
